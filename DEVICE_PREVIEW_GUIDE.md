- Use `flutter build apk --release` for production testing
- Final testing should include real devices

### **Performance**
- Device Preview adds minimal overhead in debug mode
- Hot reload works normally with device preview
- Memory usage remains reasonable for development

## 💡 **Tips for Effective Testing**

1. **Start Small**: Begin testing with the smallest supported device
2. **Test Edge Cases**: Try unusual screen sizes and orientations  
3. **Check Touch Targets**: Ensure all buttons are easily tappable
4. **Verify Text**: Confirm all text remains readable across devices
5. **Test Real Scenarios**: Use the app as an actual user would
6. **Document Issues**: Take screenshots of any layout problems

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

After using Device Preview to identify and fix layout issues:
