### "Map doesn't respond to taps"

- Check internet connection for map tiles
- Try zooming in/out to refresh the map

### "No markers visible"
- Zoom out to see if markers are outside current view

## Pro Tips

1. **Combine both methods**: Use GPS saving for quick stops, manual selection for complex parking areas

2. **Mark entrances**: Use manual selection to mark parking garage entrances instead of your exact car location

3. **Parking structures**: In multi-level parking, manually select the entrance/exit you'll use

4. **Review before confirming**: Always check the orange overlay coordinates before tapping "Confirm Location"

5. **Zoom for precision**: Zoom in close when manually selecting for maximum accuracy

6. **Test navigation**: After saving, test the "Navigate to Car" feature to ensure accuracy
